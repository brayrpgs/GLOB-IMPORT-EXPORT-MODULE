# Importation Process

## Steps to Correctly Import a CSV into the Application 🛠️📊

To successfully import a CSV file, it is necessary to have access to Jira, an existing project with relevant information, and the required permissions to export data from the project.

Additionally, ensure that the project is configured in **English**, and that all exported issues have their **headers in English**, as this is essential for proper use of the application and smooth import processing.

### Step 1: Access Jira 🟢

Log in to your Jira account and navigate to your dashboard.
